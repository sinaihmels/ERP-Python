# SIERP - An ERP System Web Application

## Description
SIERP is a comprehensive web application designed to manage your business's inventory, orders, customers, and provide insightful data visualization on the dashboard.

The project primarily utilizes Django and Python, complemented by HTML, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and JavaScript.

The project structure includes a main project folder named ERP, housing three key applications: Customers, Dashboard, and Orders.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard application features four essential HTML files: create_item.html, dashboard.html, edit_drawer.html, and inventory.html. The dashboard.html serves as the landing page, showcasing database insights through dynamic charts created with APEX and Flowbite, leveraging Django's aggregation syntax for data retrieval. Inventory.html presents a virtual inventory interface for the business, enabling seamless management of products via a table display. Users can create, edit, or delete items using modals that provide an organized user experience. 

### Customers
The Customers application encompasses four pivotal HTML files: customer_drawer.html, customer_info.html, customers.html, and new_customer.html. The customers.html page presents a comprehensive table of all customers, offering intuitive navigation to the new_customer.html page and facilitating interaction with modals showcasing customer details.

### Orders
The Orders application comprises four fundamental HTML files: customer_info.html, details_drawer.html, new_order.html, and orders.html. The orders.html page offers a structured table view of customer orders, supported by supplementary files for drawer creation and subpage management. Users can seamlessly create, view, and modify orders, ensuring efficient order management.
